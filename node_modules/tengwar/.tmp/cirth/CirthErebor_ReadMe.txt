inscriptions with Windows applications. (The Cirth alphabet was devised by 
J.R.R. Tolkien and used by the Elves, Dwarves and Humans to write in their 
native languages).

Installing Windows Fonts:
================================================================================
Once this ZIP archive has been UN-ZIPed and the files are sitting in the 
temporary folder on your computer; you must use your Windows Control Panel to 
install them properly.

The fonts must be installed using your Control Panel, moving the font files to 
the 'C\Windows\Fonts' folder doesn't always work right.  

Here's how I install Windows fonts on my Windows/98 PC 
Click on [Start]
Click on [Settings]
Click on [Control Panel]
Double-click on the Fonts icon in the Control Panel window
In the Fonts window, click on the [File] drop-down menu
Click on [Install New Font]
Navigate to the drive/folder containing the un-ZIPed font files
Click on [Select All]
Click on [OK]

Once the fonts are properly installed on your PC, they should be available for 
use in all Windows programs. 

Please now open and read my Cirth Erebor Help file.  It explain the various 
different modes and keyboard mappings.

Special Note on the commercial use of Cirth fonts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decades ago, J.R.R. Tolkien invented the Tengwar and Cirth alphabets. They are 
his intellectual property. They are part of the legacy that he left to his heirs 
and their legal representatives. Among these legal representatives are 
Authorized Publishers, Merchandisers and the Tolkien Estate.

The Tolkien Estate has most graciously granted permission to Dan Smith to freely 
distribute his Tolkien-inspired fonts on the Internet. If you want to use Dan 
Smith's Cirth fonts in a commercial product or publication, you will need to 
get formal permission from one of the following authorities:

    * Publishers: "http://www.tolkiensociety.org/links.html#publishers"
    * Merchandiser: "http://www.tolkien-ent.com/new/index.html"
    * Tolkien Estate: "http://www.elvish.org/resources.html"

Please notify Dan Smith if you do plan on using his fonts in any commercial 
product or publication. You're sure to get his blessing, and he may be able to 
help you by ensuring that the fonts are used correctly. Also, if you do plan on 
making a huge amount of money from your commercial product or publication, 
please be kind and share some of it with Dan Smith.

Distribution:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fonts may be distributed by individuals, bulletin board systems, FTP sites, 
WWW sites, etc., without restriction as long as:

    * No fee is charged for the font.
    * All files are included.
    * No files are modified.
    * If distributed as part of a "shareware library"; that I receive a copy of 
      every different disk or CD containing my fonts, to use or give away as I 
      see fit.
